### Recommendation:

We find that there are quite a few features that seem to show strong correlation to SalePrice, 
such as Overall Quality,Total Square-feet, Total basement Square feet, Ground Living area, and Totall rooms above the ground. This confirms our natural intuition: we would expect that high quality, big house with big basements and lots of rooms to be more expensive.
